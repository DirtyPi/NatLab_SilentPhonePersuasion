# NATLab Interactive Quiz Game

NATLab is a cinema facing an issue where guests often forget to turn down the volume on their phones, disturbing other movie-goers. To address this problem, we are developing an interactive quiz game that encourages guests to turn down their phone volumes before the movie starts.

The game is designed to be played through guests' phones, with questions and leaderboards displayed on the big cinema screen. Before the game begins, a notification message will remind guests to turn down their phone volumes. This will provide a subtle, yet effective way to encourage guests to reduce the volume of their phones.

In addition to promoting proper cinema etiquette, the game will offer custom quizzes for NATLab based on themes, movies, corporate events, and other preferences. This feature will allow NATLab to engage with its audience and provide a unique experience for its guests.

Over a six-week period, we will develop and test the quiz game, with regular feedback and input from the NATLab stakeholders. By the end of the project, we aim to provide NATLab with a fully functional, interactive quiz game that promotes good cinema etiquette while enhancing the guest experience.
